# Server Summary

RavoraSMP is a simple lore-driven survival server with custom resources, built on the Java Edition and running on the latest version (1.21.11).  
The experience stays close to vanilla survival while modifying the pace of progression, making it slower and more rewarding, and introducing improvements, mechanics, and items that enhance and complement the player experience - all without requiring players to install anything manually

The server is also fully integrated with our Discord server, connecting in-game events, players, and the community beyond the world itself.
