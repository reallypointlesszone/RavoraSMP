# Server Summary

RavoraSMP is a simple survival server with custom resources, built on the Java Edition and running on the latest version (1.21.11).  
The experience stays close to vanilla survival while modifying the pace of progression, making it slower and more rewarding.

The server is fully integrated with Discord, connecting in-game events, players, and the community beyond the world itself.

## Basic Lore

Every player is a **Ravorian**.

Upon awakening, all Ravorians already carry the knowledge of the **Inexoratus** — the absolute force that brings every Cycle to its end.  
This knowledge is not learned; it is remembered.

A **Cycle** is a world.  
It represents the period of progression of a group - the time in which players build, evolve, and leave their mark.

Each Cycle is divided into **Seasons**.  
Seasons transition from one to another based on the current state of the Cycle, altering progression limits and the way players evolve within the world.

When a Cycle can no longer progress — when interaction fades and no one remains to shape it - the event known as **Oblivion** begins.  
During Oblivion, the Cycle enters its closing phase, slowly collapsing and drifting toward forgetting.
